I have read and complied with the collaboration policy.

Questions:

1.) William

2.) Because Computer Science is fun. 
	Also I like the part where you can solve a single problem in various ways.
	
3.) Understand basic of programming language definition and how to write it.
	(HIGH SCORE!)
	
4.) Programming in Dr.Racket is frustrating (It does not have loops),
	but learning a new language is also the cool/interesting part.

** I used (match) in parse, but I am not sure if that is what I suppose to do.
