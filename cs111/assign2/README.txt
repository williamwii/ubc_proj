Reflection Questions:

Part 1:
	1)I usually make a little tester to test the loop after i added a new inner loop to the main loop.

	2)It's frustrating but interesting to get the right shapes as wanted. In another word, it's hard to get the correct loops.
	  The comment for some part is not really clear.	

Part 2:
	1)I only used one loop in the main method of ProfessionalMagician and it's for checking to see if the user want to quit.
	  i put most of the loops in the anwer method in QuestionAnswerer. The deepest loop in that is the second for loop for seardhing 
	  again the answer as a form of " X is Y ".
	2)No, I just used the main methog in ProfessionalMagician to test.
	3)The frustrating part is getting the right phrase from google because the search results in google is continuously changing 
	  all the time.
