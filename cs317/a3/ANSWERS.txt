#1.
Because TCP is a two way connection. After the three-way handshake, both ends can send
and receive, so the receiver of the original SYN will need to know if the sender
successfully receives the ACK of SYN. This is why the last ACK of ACK is needed for
establishing the TCO connection. On the other hand, STP is only a one way connection.
The sender of SYN can only send and receiver can only receive, so a three-way handshake
is not necessary.

#2.
In STP, the RESET packet will terminate the sending/receiving completely.
In TCP, the RST segment only tells the receiver of RST to stop sending but
the sender can still send.

#3.
Adaptive timeout retransmission can use the connection more effectively. With
fixed timeout value, if multiple packets are dropped, because they have the same
timeout, the sender will send the packets again at the same time. This will make
a congestion and lower the efficiency of the connection. Adaptive timeout avoids
this.
