Compiling and Running on *nix
=============================

The provided Makefile will compile this assignment on a number of Linux/Unix
base systems. All you need to do is run:

    make

To run the executable:

    ./raytracer

By default this will render the scene named scenes/basic.ray and save the 
resulting image as output.ppm.

To run the executable and render a different scene, pass it as the first
argument:

    ./raytracer scenes/your_scene.ray

To specify the output image filename, pass it is the second argument.

    ./raytracer scenes/your_scene.ray images/your_image.ppm



Scene Format
============

See scenes/basic.ray for a self-describing scene file.
